## Setup:  
*__Prerequisites__  
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:*  

*✔ Python (version 3.x is recommended)  
✔ Git*  

*__Cloning the Repository__  
To clone the repository to your local machine, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:*  
git clone https://github.com/KristinaPurlite/Navigating-the-AI-Landscape-A-Data-Analysis-Journey-with-Python.git  

*This will create a copy of the project on your local system. Navigate into the project directory with:*  
cd Navigating-the-AI-Landscape-A-Data-Analysis-Journey-with-Python  

*__Setting Up a Virtual Environment__  
It's recommended to create a virtual environment for the project dependencies. You can do this by running:*  
python -m venv venv  

*Activate the virtual environment with the following command:  
✔ On Windows:*  
venv\Scripts\activate  

*✔ On macOS and Linux:*  
source venv/bin/activate  

*__Installing Dependencies__  
With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies by running:*  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

*This will install all the necessary Python packages as specified in the requirements.txt file.*  

*__Running the Project__  
After installing the dependencies, you can run the Jupyter notebooks or any scripts included in the project. If you're using Jupyter notebooks, start the Jupyter Notebook server with:*  
jupyter notebook  

*Navigate to the notebooks/ directory and open the .ipynb files to view and run the analyses.*
